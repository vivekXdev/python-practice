🧠 How this works

Python cannot directly rename a file without modules

So we:

Read data from old file

Create a new file with required name

Copy content into it

📌 Effect:
Old file content → renamed_by_python.txt

⚠ Important Note (for exams)

👉 This method copies data, it does not delete old file
(Deleting needs os.remove() which is a module)

✔ Exam-ready one-line explanation

Since renaming a file directly requires modules, the file is renamed by copying its contents into a new file with the required name without using any module.

If you want:

version with module

or delete old file also

# there are 5 types of assinment operator in python
#  =   ,  -=  , +=  ,  *=  and last one /=  
# example 1

a = 5
# here a is a variaable thats contained some data , and 5 is data thats stored in location of a 
#  = is our assinment operator here

#emaple 2

x = 5
x += 2      #its means increas value of x by 2
print(x)    #output will be 7

#example 3
y = 5
y -=3       #its means decreas value of y by 3
print(y)    #output will be 2


#example 4
z = 6
z *=2       #its means muliply of value of z by 2
print(z)    #output will be 12

#example 5
p = 8
p /= 2      #its means divion of value of p by  2
print(p)    #output will be 4

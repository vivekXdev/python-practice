#there are 5 types of comparision operator
#  == ,  < ,  > ,  <= ,  >=,  !=

#NOTE: comparision operator gives always boolean in output

a = 5==5    # is 5 is equal to 5 ,its ture
            #output will be True
print(a)


a = 5>2        #output is Ture

b = 5<1        #output will be False

c = 4>=4       #output will be Ture 

d = 8<=3       #output will be False


x = 3
y = 4
print(x!=y)     #its mean, is 3 is not equal to 4 , yes this is also Ture
